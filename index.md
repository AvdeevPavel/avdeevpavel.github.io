I am a **Ph. D. Candidate** in [Mathematics](https://math.columbian.gwu.edu/) at The George Washington University (GWU). I am also currently employed as a **Graduate Research Assistant** at the [Computational Biology Institute](https://cbi.gwu.edu) at the GWU.

My current research interest lies in the development of new mathematical theories and algorithmic solutions for emerging problems in biology. I also believe that attempts to build a rigorous theory in the field of biology provide a strong motivation for formulating new fascinating problems in mathematics and computer science. You can check a [list of published papers](/publications) and a [list of completed projects](/software) that I was involved in the past years.
